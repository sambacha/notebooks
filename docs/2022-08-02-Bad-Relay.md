This document aims to provide a high level design for the payment proof
and fraud proof system used by mev-boost to secure itself against
malicious relays. The malicious relay problem is discussed
[here](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#malicious-relay-6).

Payment proofs solve the “inaccurate value” attack vector where a relay
could incorrectly report the value of the payment made to the block
proposer.

When requested, a relay provides an
[`MEVPayloadHeader`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/thegostep/docs/docs/milestone-1.md#mevpayloadheader)
which includes a `feeRecipientBalance` field representing the ending
balance of the fee recipient address of the validator proposing the
given block. Since mev-boost selects the payload with the highest ending
balance for inclusion, it must verify that the ending balance is
accurate.

To do this, we propose adding a merkle proof of the ending balance of
the fee recipient to the `MEVPayloadHeader` object. mev-boost would
verify the payment proof of all incoming payloads. Using the structure
defined by [EIP-1186](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186) the
merkle proof could conform to the following format:

-   `balance`: `QUANTITY` - the balance of the account.
-   `nonce`: `QUANTITY`, - nonce of the account.
-   `storageHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - SHA3 of the StorageRoot.
-   `codeHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the code of the account. For
    a simple Account without code it will return
    “0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470”
-   `accountProof`: `ARRAY` - Array of rlp-serialized MerkleTree-Nodes,
    starting with the stateRoot-Node, following the path of the SHA3
    (address) as key.

### [](https://hackmd.io/bTmbknkGRM6RdVCCIrRblg#Questions "Questions")Questions:

-   is this the correct proof format to use?
-   do the clients have standard methods for creating / verifying these
    proofs?

Fraud proofs solve the “invalid payload” attack vector where a relay
could propose a block that violates consensus rules.

In order to avoid outages and liveness failures, mev-boost must be
notified if a relay in the network has proposed an invalid payload and
automatically respond by rejecting payload proposals from this relay
until trust has been re-established.

To do this, we propose adding the concept of a fraud proof which allows
mev-boost to be notified of which relay proposed a payload which lead to
an invalid block proposal in the beacon chain history. This fraud proof
would include the following information:

-   `payloadHeader`:
    [`SignedMEVPayloadHeader`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/thegostep/docs/docs/milestone-1.md#signedmevpayloadheader) -
    the invalid payload header signed by the offending relay.
-   `payload`:
    [`ExecutionPayloadV1`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.1.6/specs/merge/beacon-chain.md#executionpayload) -
    the invalid payload revealed to the network.
-   `block`:
    [`SignedBlindedBeaconBlock`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/thegostep/docs/docs/milestone-1.md#signedblindedbeaconblock) -
    the invalid beacon block signed and proposed by the validator.

Upon receiving a fraud proof from a relay, mev-boost must extract the
identity of the offending relay from the signature on the
`SignedMEVPayloadHeader` and call `engine_executePayloadV1` against a
local execution client using the corresponding `ExecutionPayloadV1` to
verify that the payload validity. If the payload is invalid, mev-boost
disables the offending relay.

### [](https://hackmd.io/bTmbknkGRM6RdVCCIrRblg#Questions1 "Questions1")Questions:

-   how much time does mev-boost have to validate a fraud proof? that
    is, `engine_executePayloadV1`
-   `engine_executePayloadV1`? for example, in the event of a soft fork,
    does this fraud proof still work?

-   can a bad relay DOS mev-boost by providing too many inconclusive
    fraud proofs?

Manual review is necessary for mitigating the “missing data” attack
vector where a relay could delay revealing the transaction list of a
payload until after the block proposal deadline has passed.

We’ve not found a mechanism for automatically identifying this liveness
error as it could occur under normal operating conditions given network
latency. As such, we propose using a manual review process where the
validator is responsible for assessing a relay’s performance over time
and make a decision on continuing to receive payloads from this
provider.

We want to provide a way for a node operator to outsource the decision
of which relay to support to a third party curated list in order to
minimize burden on solo validators.
