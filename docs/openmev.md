As a result of this reality, I whole-heartedly support the right of
every OSS developer to contribute on their own terms, whatever those
terms may be. Non-paying users of free software should not get to
dictate these terms.

We must recognize that the actions of other orginziations, protocols,
etc may have undesirable side-effects on the OpenMEV community:

-   They undermine the trust that end-users and companies place in
    Ethereum
-   They increase the risk involved in deploying solutions based on
    Ethereum
-   They decrease the network value of Ethereum
-   They make OpenMEV look unprofessional to many developers, especially
    compared to Java or other ecosystems where major OSS projects would
    never behave in such a fashion

Effective immediately, I hereby codify and will support the following:

-   **Pro-Community**. All OpenMEV projects will gladly accept and host
    integrations for Flashbots, Eden Network, and other MEV or EVM
    ecosystems, without consideration of the relationships,
    dispositions, or politics between these projects and those
    ecosystems, and they will provide non-discriminatory support for
    end-users, regardless of their disposition to or affiliation or
    association with other OpenMEV community members or ecosystems.

-   **Pro-Professionalism**. Although behavior within the OpenMEV
    organization projects is already governed by
    the [OpenMEV Code of Conduct](#), I want to strengthen this code of
    conduct by making it clear that ad hominem and career sabotage has
    no place within the community. Projects in the OpenMEV organization
    exist only to help engineers and developers solve problems,
    regardless of their religion, political affliation, race, or
    disposition to or affiliation or association with other OpenMEV
    community members or ecosystems.

-   _pro-community_, as OpenMEV hosts integrations for Sushiswap
    projects *swaps* and *bentobox*, and hosts integrations
    for *OlympusDAO*,_LayerZero_ to date. Conflicting incentives should
    be considered and debated if it is possible that adding support for
    another project would conflict with existing integrations. However,
    I believe that making this behavior official will further increase
    trust and expand integrations, and also clearly set expectations for
    new projects being integrated into the OpenMEV solution sets.

- *pro-professionalism*, within OpenMEV official spaces (Github,
Discourse, etc.), I have only ever seen welcoming, inclusive, and
non-discrimantory behavior, without ad hominem or career sabotage. But
explicitly committing to this high-standard of professionalism can only
help to set expectations and provide guidance for everyone as the
organization continues to grow.

It is not necessary that open source contributors have the same views or
even like each other. We must put Ethereum first, and by being
pro-community and pro-professionalism, we can find a way to co-exist
peacefully inside this big tent, and together, we can, in different ways
and with different audiences, show the world that Ethereum is a force to
reckon with.
