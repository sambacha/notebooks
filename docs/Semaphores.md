# Semaphores

Semaphores are flags or signs used for communication and were precursors
to telegraphs and traffic lights. In programming, semaphores are usually
used to synchronize programs that share resources, where only one
process can use a resource at one time. For example, if a process has a
pool of four database connections, it would use a semaphore to manage
that pool.

Typically, semaphores are used to block a thread or process from
continuing until a resource becomes available. The process will "down"
the semaphore whenever it enters a region where it needs a resource, and
will "up" the semaphore whenever it exits that region. The terminology
goes back to raising and lowering flags. You can imagine your process as
being a train and a semaphore as guarding the entrance to a particular
length of track. Your process stops at the gate until the semaphore goes
up.

Of course, in a reactive program, we donâ€™t block. Instead of blocking,
we return promises and continue when a promise resolves. We can use a
promise as a non-blocking mutex for a single resource, and a promise
queue as a non-blocking semaphore for multiple resources.

In this example, we establish three database connections that are shared
by a function that can be called to do some work with the first
available connection. We get the resource, do our work, and regardless
of whether we succeed or fail, we put the resource back in the pool.

```js
var connections = new Queue();
connections.put(connectToDb());
connections.put(connectToDb());
connections.put(connectToDb());

function work() {
	return connections.get().then(function (db) {
		return workWithDb(db).finally(function () {
			connections.put(db);
		});
	});
}
```
