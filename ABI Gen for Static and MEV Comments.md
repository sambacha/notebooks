ABI gen for statically typed contracts?

1. Contracts need to be checked at compile times to ensure parameters etc (strong instead of number or something like that) and being statically typed is much easier to check this.

2. Inspired by geth tooling, and there are also some JS ones (salt-size etc) but were all very opinionated and made all sorts of assumptions about how you wanted to use your contracts.

3. With 0x tool: Consensys is using it, Sybil (journalism tools, also with typescript contracts).



> 1. Very interesting miner attack on EtherDelta: they front-run; make tx throw; collect the fees.

Proof of Stake

2. Getting someone slashed decreases supply, increasing value of ETH. Does this mean every ETH holder is incentivized to getting stakers slashed?

3. In the Blockchain/cryptography in general, there is attack-defense asymmetry with defence being stronger. As soon as you move towards servers, attack-defence asymmetry leans towards the attacker.
