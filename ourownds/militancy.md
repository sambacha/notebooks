Liberty is not on the side of entropy misery and totalitarianism are on the
side of entropy, and  just like misery, it is in everything else. first as you wash
up your car with the full knowledge that more dust will pile up in a very short
while but you do it anyway because a cleaned up car is preferable to a dirty one
with this realization in mind there are a few consequences one of those
consequences is that the forces of the norm left will almost always be understaffed in some
departments let's explore   

I'm going to try to explain why the forces of the norm left are and will continue to be understaffed and why this matters how can we change
some of this and what are and will be the main obstacles.

so let's start with the
activities 

Activities in which the forces of the non left are understaffed 

It follows that there are fewer non leftist actors than they are leftist ones and this
holds true for every arts related field with the possible exception of video games,
there are also fewer non leftist activists then they are leftists though some would argue 
that this is not the case in the United States. In the video there are also fewer 
non leftist apparatchiks then they are leftist ones[^1]

Footnotes:

[^1]: apparatchiks; the word apparatchik comes from the old Soviet Union. It is the pinnacle of the institutional left in every single country past and
present regardless of culture race creed timezone or anything else really and this has
been true throughout history
