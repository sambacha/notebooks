# Post-Merge APY Analysis

After the merge and transition to Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum validators
will earn rewards from four distinct paths:

-   Attestation rewards for successfully attesting to proposed blocks
    (**sent to the validator address on the Beacon Chain**)
-   Block proposal rewards for successfully proposing a block (**sent to
    the validator address on the Beacon Chain**)
-   Priority fees (formerly transaction fees) (**sent to the proposed
    block's `coinbase` address on eth1**)
-   [Maximum Extracted Value (MEV)](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/94613/what-is-miner-extracted-value-mev)
    (**sent to an arbitrary address on eth1**)

As part of the conversation surrounding the Merge, there has been much
speculation regarding the impacts of the latter two portions on a
validator's annual returns. Many discussions tend to target best-case or
worst-case scenarios, which are useful in thought experiments but need
to be analyzed in terms of practical numbers to assess their true merit.
Unfortunately, reliable numbers for priority fees and MEV extraction in
a Proof of Stake world are not currently possible to derive due to the
unknown impacts of EIP 1559 and Layer 2 solutions. The best we as a
community can do is estimate based on existing data.

As part of our exploration into the consequences of priority fees and
MEV on Rocket Pool, we have constructed a model that includes all four
reward paths. Our analysis is based on this model. These numbers are
meant to serve as **rough estimates only** and will almost certainly
deviate significantly from real-world conditions after the merge, but
the raw numbers themselves are not particularly important; rather, we
use this model to assess the **relative differences** across various
scenarios. If the numbers are inaccurate, they should impact each
scenario in the same way. This means that the relative differences are
preserved.

Our model is available in this repository as `FeeMEVAnalysis.xlsx`.
Below is a walkthrough of the context surrounding the model.

## Variables

The following variables are used in our model:

-   **Slots per year**: We use **2,629,746** for the expected number of
    slots (blocks) per year. This is derived from the fact that the
    Beacon Chain expects a slot every **12 seconds**. To reach this, we
    state that a year is **365.2425 days** long.
-   **Staked ETH**: The amount of ETH staked by validators.
-   **Issuance ETH**: The amount of ETH generated per year from
    attestation and block proposal rewards (taken from
    [Justin Drake's model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslqTnECKvi7_l4x6lbyRhNtzW9f6CVEzwDf04zprfA/edit?usp=sharing))
-   **Number of Validators**: Directly derived from the total staked
    ETH.
-   **Gas Price in gwei**: The average gas price to use when calculating
    the impact of priority fees.
-   **Daily Fees in ETH**: The amount of ETH provided from priority fees
    per day, using the provided gas price (estimated using a 15,000,000
    gas limit per block).
-   **Burn Rate**: The amount of the priority fees that are burned after
    EIP 1559 has been introduced.
-   **Fees per Year**: The per-year earnings for validators from the
    non-burned portion of priority fees.
-   **Slots per Year**: The average number of slots (blocks) that a
    validator will be given, derived from the slots per year and the
    number of validators on the network.
-   **Reward per Slot**: The average amount of ETH minted per block on
    the Beacon Chain - derived from the annual issuance divided by the
    number of slots per year.
-   **Fees per Slot**: The average amount of priority fees that are
    transferred to a validator as part of a block proposal - derived
    from the fees generated per year, divided by the number of slots per
    year.
-   **MEV per Slot**: An estimate for the average MEV earnings taken by
    a validator in a block proposal. These figures were extracted from
    [this recent study by Flashbots](https://hackmd.io/@flashbots/mev-in-eth2).
-   **RP Node Commission**: The commission awarded to a Rocket Pool
    minipool for the sake of this analysis.

## Analysis Assumptions

In our analysis, we use the following figures:

-   **6,000,000 staked ETH** which corresponds to **187,500 validators**
    on the network - a close approximate to the number of validators on
    mainnet today. For future projections, we have also included columns
    with higher amounts of ETH staked in the model.
-   **20 gwei** for a gas price, which is a reasonable figure given the
    recent trends in the market.
-   **0.1 ETH of MEV per slot**.
-   A **10%** Rocket Pool commission.

Using these numbers, we obtain the following **baseline results for a
solo staker**:

-   2.17 ETH per year from Beacon Chain rewards (block proposal and
    attestation rewards), which results in **6.78% APY** without
    priority fees or MEV included.
-   0.97 ETH per year from priority fees, which accounts for a **3.04%
    APY** from fees alone
-   1.40 ETH per year from MEV, which accounts for a **4.36% APY** from
    MEV

All told, this sums to 4.54 ETH per year on average, which corresponds
to a **14.19% APY** for a solo staker.

## Baseline Scenarios

In Rocket Pool's case, a node operator only stakes 16 of their own ETH.
The current usage of the 0x01 credentials means that validator duty
rewards are fairly socialized between the node operator and the rETH
staking pool which contributed the supplemental 16 ETH, minus a small
commission to incentivize the node operator.

If we assume that commission is the average of 10%, then a node operator
can be expected to earn 55% of the typical validation-based rewards,
which comes to 1.19 ETH per year. However, this validator will still
earn **all** of the MEV and priority fees, which were earlier estimated
at 2.37 ETH. This reveals that as-is today, a Rocket Pool node operator
would earn 3.56 ETH in rewards per year, which is a **22.25% APY**.

These supplemental rewards don't come from nowhere; they are effectively
stolen from the staking pool. The staking pool would be left with 45% of
the 2.17 ETH generated on eth2 from proposal and attestation rewards,
which amounts to 0.98 ETH. This is a reward of **6.10% APR**.

This can be seen in the **Not sharing fees or MEV** scenario in the
model.

This indicates that without taking any action, other pools have the
capability of offering a staking return rate up to 14.19% whereas Rocket
Pool would only be able to offer 6.10% (in the worst case where _none_
of the node operators share their priority fees or MEV earnings). This
discrepancy is the source of the problem revealed by the conversation
surrounding the `0x02` proposal.

We have included another scenario in the model, titled **Sharing fees
not MEV**, that reflects a scenario where `0x02` is accepted and
priority fees are distributed fairly. In the scenario, the node operator
earns 3.12 ETH per year (a **19.52% APY**) while the rETH staking pool
earns 1.31 ETH per year (an **8.84% APY**). This is better than the
previous scenario, but still falls short of competitive rates. It also
assumes that priority fees would not change in response to `0x02`,
whereas the discussion of the proposal indicated that it would encourage
side-channel payments and thus reduce the actual priority fees being
distributed. Nevertheless, this scenario is included as a point of
reference.

A scenario in which _everyone_ shared their rewards appropriately would
result in 2.50 ETH per year for node operators (a **15.60% APY**) and
2.04 ETH per year for the rETH staking pool (a **12.76% APY**). This is
shown in the **Sharing** scenario in the model. It demonstrates that if
socialization of all rewards can be enforced, then the pool is
immediately competitive with other offerings which can offer a **maximum
of 14.19%** (but will likely take a commission on MEV earnings and
priority fees as well, which will lower this amount).

These scenarios are summarized in the following table.

| Scenario                                                               | Node Operator Returns     | rETH Pool Returns         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Solo staking, normalized to<br/>16 ETH (for reference)                 | 2.27 ETH (**14.19% APY**) | 2.27 ETH (**14.19% APY**) |
| Sharing all returns                                                    | 2.50 ETH (**15.60% APY**) | 2.04 ETH (**12.76% APY**) |
| Sharing priority fees but not MEV<br/>(requires `0x02` to be accepted) | 3.12 ETH (**19.52% APY**) | 1.31 ETH (**8.84% APY**)  |
| Not sharing any rewards                                                | 3.56 ETH (**22.25% APY**) | 0.98 ETH (**6.10% APR**)  |

The team is currently exploring ways to incentivize fair sharing of
these rewards with the rETH staking pool, and have suggested several
options described in the [Incentivization](./Incentivization.md) and
[Security](./Security.md) sections appropriately. The relevant
enforcement mechanism discussed here is the **slashing and negative
commission** system. In this system, when a "cheater" is detected, the
node operator's RPL is auctioned and their commission is set to a
negative amount. The proceeds from the RPL auction, and a large a mount
of the validator's Beacon Chain balance, are then provided to the rETH
staking pool as compensation for the stolen funds.

For more information on this system and its corresponding detection
mechanisms, please visit the [Security](./Security.md) section.

## Scenarios Including Enforcement

This segment of the model demonstrates what happens to a node operator's
returns in the event that they are detected during selfish activities
and punished by the slashing and negative commission system. They assume
that **75% of the validator's balance** on the Beacon Chain will be
refunded to the rETH staking pool (a commission rate of -75%). This was
chosen as an arbitrary but severe penalty because as the penalty
increases, less total ETH is given to the node operator and thus they
have less incentive to exit the validator. In the worst case, they could
hold the Beacon Chain balance "hostage" out of spite, ensuring that the
rETH pool never receives its fair share from that validator. This value
could certainly be optimized in the future, and could even vary
depending on the severity of the node operator's transgressions.

The model reveals the following scenarios (assuming there is **no
compounding interest**, after **11 years of operation**):

| Scenario                                                                            | Node Operator Returns   | rETH Pool Returns       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Sharing all returns                                                                 | 27.45 ETH (**171.59%**) | 22.46 ETH (**140.39%**) |
| Sharing priority fees but not MEV,<br/>and slashed (requires `0x02` to be accepted) | 22.36 ETH (**139.76%**) | 27.55 ETH (**172.22%**) |
| Not sharing any rewards, and slashed                                                | 27.17 ETH (**169.82%**) | 22.74 ETH (**142.16%**) |

This indicates that using the model's averaged projections for priority
fees and MEV earnings, it will take **over 11 years** to break even and
begin earning more via cheating than a node operator would via sharing.
It also indicates that `0x02`'s acceptance would offer a nontrivial
security benefit to Rocket Pool in cases where priority fees are not
completely overshadowed by MEV earnings, but is not explicitly required
for Rocket Pool's success.

Adjusting the numbers for variance lowers this break-even point, but it
is still a major disincentive to act selfishly. For example,
_quadrupling_ the expected MEV rewards to 0.4 ETH per block will still
result in a break-even period of **over 4 years** if a node operator
pockets the priority fees and MEV earnings.

## Summary

This model demonstrates that with the estimates for MEV earnings and
priority fees proposed by the Flashbots team and Justin Drake, Rocket
Pool can be made quite competitive through the use of incentivization
and protocol rule enforcement. That being said, we want to reiterate
that **these figures are meant purely for relative comparison** of the
provided scenarios. They are not intended to be used as a reference for
Rocket Pool's projected return rates.

We encourage the community to explore the model, improve it where
possible, and use it to discuss the implications for Rocket Pool and the
post-merge Ethereum chain as a whole.
